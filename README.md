## Forest-Type-Classification 
### ðŸŒ² Predicting forest cover type from strictly cartographic variables 

#### Course: Machine Learning II
#### Task:
This is a programming assignment where you have to implement a working solution for a Machine Learning problem. In more detail, we are going to participate in the Forest Cover Type Prediction in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/overview. The competition has already ended, but it allows the late submission of results.



This task proposes a **classification problem**: predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data). The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. We are asked to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are:

* Spruce/Fir
* Lodgepole Pine
* Ponderosa Pine
* Cottonwood/Willow
* Aspen
* Douglas-fir
* Krummholz
The training set (15120 observations) contains both features and the Cover_Type. The test set contains only the features.

**We are asked to predict the Cover_Type for every row in the test set (565892 observations).**
